# PicoCTF Web Exploitation 1-4

## 1. GET aHEAD

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

Maybe you have more than 2 choices

Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

</details>

**Description:** Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition [http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/)

Clicking on the provided link, there are two buttons. One that changes the background color to red and another that changes the background color to blue. There doesn't seem to be much we can do from here.

From the provided hints, this challenge suggests that we utilize Burpsuite to modify our requests to the given server. From the "Proxy" tab, to "Intercept" tab, open Burpsuite's built-in browser. Turn the intercept on and paste the link into the browser.

If Burpsuite intercepted the request, you should see information under the intercept section.

With the intercepted data, we see one piece of the puzzle, "GET", also seen in the title of this challenge. The "GET" represents a method or verb to specify the type of action it wants the server to perform. This method is used when the client wants to retrieve data from the server without causing any modification or side effects on the server.

Another HTTP method we see in the title of this challenge is "HEAD". This method is similar to "GET" in that it requests information about a resource from the server. However, the "HEAD" method only retrieves the metadata or headers of the resource, without including the actual content of the resource in the response.

Through the Burpsuite window, we can alter the "GET" to "HEAD" and see what this does. After making the change, forward the response. Forwarding the response reveals the flag for this challenge.

## 2. Cookies

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

(None)

</details>

**Description:** Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/)

From the name of this challenge, its safe to assume we will need to do something about the cookies stored in this website. Upon clicking the link, we are shown an entry box for inputting types of cookies.

The entry suggests snickerdoodle, so we try that. That didn't seem to do much, lets inspect the coookies stored in the application. Inspect element the page by right clicking and pressing on "inspect" and navigate to the "Application" tab then "Cookies".

Notice a cookie called "Name" and a value of "0". Here we can alter the value of the cookie, and see what that will return. Double clicking on the value we want to alter and inputting our own data, gives us the ability to see that specific cookie's output.

Enter "1" for the cookie's value and refresh the page, this gives us chocolate chip cookies. While a value of "2" gives us oatmeal raisin cookies. Keep going until we reach the flag refreshing the page every time we enter a new value.

## 3. Insp3ct0r

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

How do you inspect web code on a browser?

There's 3 parts

</details>

**Description:** Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511

Upon clicking the link, we are met with a very basic website. Navigating through it's tabs don't get us anywhere. From the name of the challenge and the "Inspect Me" letters at the top of the page, we'll need to inspect the contents of the site.

Right clicking anywhere on the page gives us a drop down menu, click on "Inspect" to view the code of the site. Clicking on the various dropdown buttons throughout the HTML code leads us to the first third of the flag. Seeing how one-third is hidden within the HTML code of the site, we're going to need to find the CSS and JavaScript portions too.

It didn't take long to find either of these, as they are located in the "Sources" tab. The "Sources" tab lists index, myjs.js, and myccs.css. Clicking on each respective module, each gives us the remaining portions of the flag.

## 4. Scavenger Hunt

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

</details>

**Description:** There is some interesting information hidden around this site [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/). Can you find it?

Navigate to the website, it seems like the same one as the last challenge. Again, inspect element the page. In the "Sources" tab analyze the index and css files for the first 2 parts of the flag.

The JavaScript file, doesn't seem to give us a portion of the flag, rather, another hint. The hint has to do with keeping Google from indexing a website. Upon further [research](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing), Google makes mention of a robots.txt file. According to Google, "A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site." To access the "robots.txt" file, change the end directory of the website to robots.txt.

Our next portion of the flag, along with our next hint lies here. Mentioning an apache server. Searching up "Apache files", leads to[ Apache's Configuration Files](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/configuring.html#htaccess) document. Making mention of a .htaccess file that "provide a way to make configuration changes on a per-directory basis".Changing the directory from "robots.txt" to ".htaccess", gives us access to the Apache configuration file.

This gives leads us to the next part of the flag and a hint regarding Mac and storing information. Searching for "Mac store file" lead me to information regarding the .DS\_store file. This file, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS\_Store), is "a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as folder view options, icon positions, and other visual information." This time, change the directory to ".DS\_Store". This leads us to the last portion of the flag.
