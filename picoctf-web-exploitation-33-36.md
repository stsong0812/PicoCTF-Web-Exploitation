We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52025/).

Looking at the sources of the website, we see a secret/assets directory containing an image and the css page for index. Lets try to change directories to the /secret directory.

Similarly, in the secret directory, we see a /hidden directory within it. Again, change directories to our hidden directory.
