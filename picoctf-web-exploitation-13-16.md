# PicoCTF Web Exploitation 13-16

## 13. Includes

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

</details>

**Description:** Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54554/) and see what you can discover.

On the website, there includes a paragraph regarding the "Include Directive" and a button. Pressing the "Say hello" button states "This code is in a separate file!"

Inspect elementing the page, navigate to the "Sources" tab and observe the different source files. The "script.js" file contains the message shown when the button is pressed. The source code seems to contain a portion of the flag.

Additionally, another file, "styles.css" contains the background color style for the site along with the first half of the flag.

Piece together both flags.

## 14. Inspect HTML

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

What is the web inspector in web browsers?

</details>

Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52681/) and see what you can discover.

Visiting the website, there doesn't seem to be much to work on to obtain the flag. Inspect element the page to view its HTML code.&#x20;

## 15. Local Authority

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

How is the password checked on this website?

</details>

**Description:** Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55983/) and see what you can discover.

Visit the website and start by inspect elementing the page. There doesn't seem to be much we can work off of. Attempting to log in with any default credentials gives us a Log In Failed message.&#x20;

Inspect this new "Log In Failed" page, navigating to "Sources" notice our HTML code makes reference to a JavaScript file called "secure.js". This JS file has the check password function with the correct username and password in plaintext.

Log in with our new credentials and we are given the flag.

## 16. Search Source

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?

</details>

**Description:** The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52523/)

It seems this challenge requires us to look through the source code of the website. In the site, right click the page and inspect element the page. We see a comment in the HTML code telling us the flag is probably not here but to keep digging. This tells us the flag is probably in plaintext somewhere throughout the source code.

Navigate to the source code folder and first parse through the first folder "css". We can expedite the process of looking for the flag with control + f. Enter pico and look through each css file and we will eventually find the flag.
