**Description:** [http://mercury.picoctf.net:43997/index.html](http://mercury.picoctf.net:43997/index.html)

Inspecting the source of the page, we see that the HTML code includes a JS script. We can download the JavaScript file by right clicking on the filename in the "Sources" tab. Download the file and auto-format it in a code editor.

Again, we see a reference to WebAssembly. It looks like the wasm module is being used to perform operations related to checking the flag the user enters. Return to the sources tab in the site and open the wasm file.&#x20;

## 30. Forbidden Paths

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

(None)

</details>

**Description:** Can you get the flag?Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:52278/). We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Looking at the website, we know that it reads the text files that we input into the filename field. From the challenge description we know the path to the HTML page and where our flag is located. More specifically, it looks like the flag file is in our root directory, while our website is 4 directories down.

&#x20;Knowing this we can traverse backwards through the directory 4 times to use the website to read the flag file.

## 31. Power Cookie

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

Do you know how to modify cookies?

</details>

**Description:** Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:57688/) and see what you can discover.

Continuing as guest on the site, we get a message that doesn't take us anywhere. Looking at the cookies stored on the website, observe the "isAdmin" cookie.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot_2023-06-07_14_11_31.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Currently, the cookie is set to 0 for false. Change the cookie's value to "1" for true through any cookie editor. Refresh the page and we are given the flag.

## 32. Roboto Sans

<details>

<summary>Provided Hints:</summary>

(None)

</details>

**Description:** The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it. Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64271/) out.

The title of the challenge seems to make reference to a font family. Looking at the Source files that make reference to "Roboto" doesn't seem to give us much.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot_2023-06-07_14_18_13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Instead, the site may be making reference to the "robots.txt" file. Changing directories to the robots.txt file, we see what looks to be 3 base64 encoded string. Attempting to decode them gives us the path "js/myfile.txt".

Navigating to this directory give us our flag.
